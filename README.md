# **Scara Robot**
The aim of the project is to create a .cpp program which generate an SVG drawing of a SCARA Robot as shown in this figure:
![](build/scara.svg)

# **Getting Started**
To run the code on your local machine just clone this repository.

* Branch "*main*" contains working stuff you can execute on your machine.
* Branch "*dev*" contains code being developed and which might not work.


### **Prerequisites**
To run this program you need to install CMAke tools

# **Guide to the program**
## <a name="param"></a> Parameters
* **thickness**: is the width of the robotic arms; these will have equal thickness.
* **length**: is the length of the arms, both arms will have equal length.
* **radius**: is the radius for both revolute joints
* **q1**: is the angle of the first arm of the robot measured from the x axis
* **q2**: is the angle of the second arm of the robot measured from the first arm of the robot
* **(x,y)**: are the coordinates of the centre of the first revolute joint. these coordinates are referred to the top left corner of the svg file.

### **Constraints**
The device must satisfy these constraints:
*  all dimension **must** be  strictly positive values
*  the radius of revolute joints must be less than or equal to a half of the thickness of the arms.
*  arms have the same width
*  arms of different lengths are **not** allowed
*  the angle of the second arm must be different from 0 with respect to the first arm
## **Device building functions**
### **`fc_scara_init`**

````
fc_scara* fc_scara_init( int thickness, int length,  int radius, int q1, int q2, int x, int y);
````
Use this function to build your first machine.
It's implementation in [`fc_scara.cpp`](https://github.com/FedericoCorso/homework1/blob/dev/src/fc_scara.cpp) file contains some line of code which will prompt the user for values. This section could be deleted and placed in the `main.cpp` file.
#### **Function description**
The function takes as input all the parameters which define the robot, if these don't follow the given constraints the function will return a `NULL` pointer.

### **`fc_set_` functions**
````
int fc_set_thickness();
int fc_set_length();
int fc_set_radius();
int fc_set_q1();
int fc_set_q2();
int fc_set_frame();
````
These functions can be used to modify each parameter according to constraints.

### **`fc_delete_robot()`**
This function deletes the memory allocated in the heap by the `fc_scara_init` function. 

## **File handling functions**
### **`fc_scara_to_svg()`**
This function converts a structure into an svg representation of the same.
Give it as input a `fc_scara*` pointer and the function will return a string with the svg representation of the structure. 
This function could be used to check the structure before saving it or doing other operations.
### **`fc_svg_to_scara`**
This function read an svg file to extract data for a new structure.
The function works if the svg follow a 'special' syntax.
Significant parameters are inside svg instructions such as "rotate, translate, width, ...".
Every instruction, which contains significant parameters, in the svg file created with `fc_scara_init` function start with this sequence of characters:
* "`"= "`" : note that after the equal sign there's a blank space. This difference make it easier to find values for parameters.

And end with this char:
* "`"`" : because at the end of each command in svg you will find double quotes. 

### **`fc_load_from_file`**
Use this function to load a structure from an existing file.
It takes as input the name of the file and it returns a pointer to the memory allocated for the structure.
### **`fc_scara_save`**
Use this function to save a structure to a new file or to overwrite an existing file.
The function won't ask for confirmation before overwriting.
## **User interface programs**
### **Commandline program `main.cpp`**
The `main.cpp`file contains a basic command line program which allows the user to create, load and save an svg file.
This functin will explicitly ask the user the values of the parameters given in the [parameters list above](#param)
### **`fc_ask_parameters()`**
Use this function in the program to ask parameters to the user in a simple way
